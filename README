One is a language for formatting data.
It is intended to easily and dynamically create text and binary files with ease.
An important possibility of One will be that it will be possible to use it as a programming language.
There will be an application library specification that will give a standard interface to which application code can be written.
Another way One can be used is by creating assembly code files that can be turned into application binaries.

A quick example of how One source code might look like:


& "include.1" 

@my.namespace (

$main (
	$myString[ emph num ] (
		"Hello World"
		% ($i 0, 'i < emph', 'i++')
			"!"
	)

	#utf8 myString[3]
)

main

? 'myvar == 3'  "\n"
!               "\0"


This will give output identical to:

	Hello World!!!

Encoded in UTF-8 and ending with a newline or zero byte depending on myvar.
