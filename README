One is a language for formatting data.
An important possibility of One will be that it will be possible to use it as a programming language.

The one compiler depends on libchi, which is an header-only C++ library that provides the framework for the compiler's code.

To build the One compiler, you first need libchi. This is done simply by the command:

	make dep

This sets up - and downloads the git repository of libchi.
Once that is done, you can build the compiler with:

	make

And test-run it with:

	make test

This runs it with gdb and tries to compile the file test/example.1

To test other files, you can simply do something like this:
bin/one my_input_file.1 > my_output_file

Have fun!
